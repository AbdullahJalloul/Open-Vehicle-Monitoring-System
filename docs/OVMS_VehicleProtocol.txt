Roadster Charge Monitor Protocol

UDP/IP protocol
Car <-> Server

  <message> ::= <magic> <version> <protection> <vehicleid> <space> {<protectionkey> <space>} <servermsg> { <appmsg> }

  <magic> ::= MP
  <version> ::= 1 byte version number - this protocol is 0x30
  <protection> ::= 1 byte protection scheme - 0x30 is none, 0x31 is RC4
  <vehicleid> ::= N byte vehicle identifier
  <protectionkey> ::= N byte protection key (used for protection scheme 0x31 only)
  <space> ::= ' ' (ascii 0x20)

  <servermsg> ::= <servertocarmsg> | <cartoservermsg>
  <servertocarmsg> ::- "S" <payload>
  <cartoservermsg> ::= "C" <payload>

  <appmsg> ::= "A" <payload>

  <payload> ::= <code> <data>
  <code> ::= 1 byte instruction code
  <data> ::= N bytes data (dependent on instruction code)

The <servermsg> is encrypted with the car-server key.
The <appmsg> is encrypted with the car-app key.
The car can send <cartoserver> and <appmsg> types.
The server can send <servertocar> type.
If the high bit of the code is 1, then an acknowledgement is required.

The following message payload codes and data are supported:

0x41 PING
Sent <cartoserver> or <servertocar> to check connectivity.

0x42 ACK
Sent <servertocar> or <cartoserver> to acknowledge a message that requests acknowledgement.
<data> is 1 byte code of the message being acknowledged.

0x43 PUSH NOTIFICATION
Sent <appmsg> to ask the server to push a notification to the App.
<data> is 1 byte alert type followed by N bytes of textual message.

0x44/0x64 CAN SUBSCRIPTION

<data> is 2 byte CAN bus ID optionally followed by 1 byte D0 to match.

0x45/0x65 CAN CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION
Sent <servertocar> to request cancellation of CAN bus messages to the App.
<data> is 2 byte CAN bus ID optionally followed by 1 byte D0 to match.

0x46 CAN DATA
Sent <cartoserver> to forward a message found on the can bus.

0x47/0x67 VEHICLE LOCATION
Sent <servertocar>, <cartoserver> or <appmsg> to request/indicate the last known vehicle location.
<data> is:
  N bytes latitude, longitude in textual format
(for <cartoserver> or <appmsg>)

0x48 CHARGE STATE
Sent <servertocar>, <cartoserver> or <appmsg> to request/indicate the last known charge state.
<data> is comma-separated list of:
  SOC
  Units ("M" for miles, "K" for kilometers)
  Line voltage
  Charge current
  Charge state (charging, topoff, done, preparingtocharge, stopped)
  Charge mode (standard, storage, range, performance)
  Ideal range
  Estimated range.

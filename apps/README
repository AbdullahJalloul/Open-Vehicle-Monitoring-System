Open Vehicle Monitoring System

The CellPhone Apps

The API to the car and the server is open and will be published. Anyone can write to it, and we hope they will.

Initially, we intend to release a standard iPhone and Android App, but anyone is welcome to follow the API
and write their own.

GIT Repositories

The cellphone apps have been moved to their own repositories, in github. You can find them here:

Android: https://github.com/markwj/Open-Vehicle-Android
iOS:     https://github.com/markwj/Open-Vehicle-iOS

All work on those apps will continue in those repositories.

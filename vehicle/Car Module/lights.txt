WHAT THE LIGHTS MEAN
====================

The RED light is the ACTivity light.
The GREEN light is the NETwork light.

COMBINATIONS
============

GREEN light off, RED light slow blinking alternately on and off roughly once a second:

  The system is trying to reset the GSM connection. It has previously lost GSM connectivity, so
  is now waiting for the modem to stabilise before trying to establish a connection to the
  network carrier again. This combination should persist for 30 seconds.

GREEN light and RED light slow alternatively blinking roughly once a second:

  The system is trying to establish a GSM connection with the carrier. This combination should
  persist for at most 240 seconds (and usually much less unless there is a GSM connectivity
  issue).

RED light fully on, and GREEN light off:

  The system is having problems communicating with the modem and is performing a hard
  reset. This combination should persist for at most 10 seconds.

RED light completely off (never on) and GREEN light off:

  The system has lost GSM connectivity and is waiting for it to come back. This combination
  should persist for at most 120 seconds.

RED light completely off (never on) and GREEN light on:

  The GSM network is up. The GPRS link has not been (or is being) established.
  This is the ideal state if you have not configured GPRS but want just GSM (SMS) control.

RED light short rapid blinks, and GREEN light solid on:

  Both the GSM and GPRS networks are up and connected ok.
  This is the ideal state if you have configured GPRS.

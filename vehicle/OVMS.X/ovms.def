// The OVMS_CAN_WRITE switch controls the CAN mode of the OVMS system
// Leaving it undefined (the default) will put the CAN bus in LISTEN mode. It
// will not be written to and no acnkowledgements will be issued on the bus.
// Defining it will put the CAN bus in NORMAL mode. This will allow the
// system to co-operate with the CAN bus (eg; issuing acknowledgements) and
// also give it the ability to transmit messages on the CAN bus.
// Not defining OVMS_CAN_WRITE is obviously less likely to interfere with
// the vehicle normal operations.
//#define OVMS_CAN_WRITE

// The OVMS_CAR_2010 switch should be defined if the vehicle is a 2010 (or
// later) roadster.
#define OVMS_CAR_2010

// The OVMS_SUPPRESS_ACCESSDENIED_SMS switch prevents the OVMS net_sms module
// from sending "access denied" SMS (for some operators/plans, SMS are charged
// on per use basis)
//#define OVMS_SUPPRESS_ACCESSDENIED_SMS

// The OVMS_SUPPRESS_OUTGOING_SMS switch prevents the OVMS net_sms module from
// sending all SMS messages (useful for data-only plans with expensive SMS rates)
//#define OVMS_SUPPRESS_OUTGOING_SMS

// The OVMS_SPEEDO_EXPERIMENT switch is a highly experimental feature to
// change the dashboard Amps display in the Tesla Roadster to show speed.
// Please take extreme care with this and consider it extremely experimental -
// use at your own risk. The feature can transmit a lot of messages on the bus
// and is spoofing the car message. We can't see any affect (and we've even put
// an analyser on at the same time to see if any errors come up - they don't),
// but it is very intrusive to the car. One concern we have is if the car is
// using that message for anything else (but we can't see how it would as it
// also contains data for the battery level display, estimated miles, etc -
// it seems very very specific to that dashboard display).
// We really don't want anyone breaking their cars with this.
//#define OVMS_SPEEDO_EXPERIMENT

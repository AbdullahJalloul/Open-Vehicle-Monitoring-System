// The OVMS_SPEEDO_EXPERIMENT switch is a highly experimental feature to
// change the dashboard Amps display in the Tesla Roadster to show speed.
// Please take extreme care with this and consider it extremely experimental -
// use at your own risk. The feature can transmit a lot of messages on the bus
// and is spoofing the car message. We can't see any affect (and we've even put
// an analyser on at the same time to see if any errors come up - they don't),
// but it is very intrusive to the car. One concern we have is if the car is
// using that message for anything else (but we can't see how it would as it
// also contains data for the battery level display, estimated miles, etc -
// it seems very very specific to that dashboard display).
// We really don't want anyone breaking their cars with this.
//#define OVMS_SPEEDO_EXPERIMENT

// The OVMS_SOCALERT switch will enable a feature such that if the SOC falls
// below 5%, and the car is switched off (ie; not driving), the car will alert
// (by SMS and net PUSH msg) every twelve hours, until such time as the SOC
// recovers to at least 5%.
#define OVMS_SOCALERT

// The OVMS project started with support for v2.x Tesla Roadsters, and was
// then extended to support v1.5 Tesla Roadsters. Now, it is being extended
// to support other car types as well, with the first being the Volt/Ampera.
// So, we now have switches to control which car type is to be built. Only
// one of the following should be defined.
//#define OVMS_CAR_TESLAROADSTER
//#define OVMS_CAR_VOLTAMPERA
